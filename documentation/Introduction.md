# Introduction

> The Linux kernel is a Unix-like computer operating system kernel. It is used world-wide: the Linux operating system is based on it and deployed on both traditional computer systems such as personal computers and servers, usually in the form of Linux distributions, and on various embedded devices such as routers, switches, WAPs, PBX, STBs, FTA, Smart TV, PVR, NAS appliances and much more.
