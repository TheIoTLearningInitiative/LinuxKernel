# Introduction

> The Linux kernel is a Unix-like computer operating system kernel. It is used world-wide: the Linux operating system is based on it and deployed on both traditional computer systems such as personal computers and servers, usually in the form of Linux distributions, and on various embedded devices such as routers, switches, WAPs, PBX, STBs, FTA, Smart TV, PVR, NAS appliances and much more.

## Kernel Newbies

> Kernelnewbies is a community of aspiring Linux kernel developers who work to improve their Kernels and more experienced developers willing to share their knowledge. Kernelnewbies can be found on the MailingList, IRC (irc.oftc.net #kernelnewbies), the web forum and this wiki. [Homepage](http://kernelnewbies.org/)

## Books

### [Mastering Embedded Linux Programming](http://techbus.safaribooksonline.com/book/operating-systems-and-server-administration/linux/9781784392536)

> This book is ideal for Linux developers and system programmers who are already familiar with embedded systems and who want to know how to create best-in-class devices. A basic understanding of C programming and experience with systems programming is needed.

### [Linux Kernel in a Nutshell](http://techbus.safaribooksonline.com/book/operating-systems-and-server-administration/linux/0596100795)

> Written by a leading developer and maintainer of the Linux kernel, Linux Kernel in a Nutshell is a comprehensive overview of kernel configuration and building, a critical task for Linux users and administrators.


### [The Art of Linux Kernel Design](http://techbus.safaribooksonline.com/book/programming/linux/9781466518032)

> Difficulty in understanding an operating system (OS) lies not in the technical aspects, but in the complex relationships inside the operating systems. The Art of Linux Kernel Design: Illustrating the Operating System Design Principle and Implementation addresses this complexity. Written from the perspective of the designer of an operating system, this book tackles important issues and practical problems on how to understand an operating system completely and systematically. It removes the mystery, revealing operating system design guidelines, explaining the BIOS code directly related to the operating system, and simplifying the relationships and guiding ideology behind it all.


### [Professional Linux Kernel Architecture](http://techbus.safaribooksonline.com/book/operating-systems-and-server-administration/linux/9780470343432)

> Find an introduction to the architecture, concepts and algorithms of the Linux kernel in Professional Linux Kernel Architecture, a guide to the kernel sources and large number of connections among subsystems. Find an introduction to the relevant structures and functions exported by the kernel to userland, understand the theoretical and conceptual aspects of the Linux kernel and Unix derivatives, and gain a deeper understanding of the kernel. Learn how to reduce the vast amount of information contained in the kernel sources and obtain the skills necessary to understand the kernel sources.

### [Linux Kernel Development](http://techbus.safaribooksonline.com/book/programming/linux/9780768696974)

> Linux Kernel Development details the design and implementation of the Linux kernel, presenting the content in a manner that is beneficial to those writing and developing kernel code, as well as to programmers seeking to better understand the operating system and become more efficient and productive in their coding.

### [Understading the Linux Kernel](http://techbus.safaribooksonline.com/book/operating-systems-and-server-administration/linux/0596005652)

> The third edition of Understanding the Linux Kernel takes you on a guided tour of the most significant data structures, algorithms, and programming tricks used in the kernel. Probing beyond superficial features, the authors offer valuable insights to people who want to know how things really work inside their machine. Important Intel-specific features are discussed. Relevant segments of code are dissected line by line. But the book covers more than just the functioning of the code; it explains the theoretical underpinnings of why Linux does things the way it does.

### [Embedded Linux Projects Using Yocto Project Cookbook](http://techbus.safaribooksonline.com/book/programming/linux/9781784395186)

> This book begins with the installation of a professional embedded Yocto setup, then advises you on best practices, and finally explains how to quickly get hands on with the Freescale ARM ecosystem and community layer, using the affordable and open source Wandboard embedded board.
