## Kernel Debugger

> The kernel has two different debugger front ends (kdb and kgdb) which interface to the debug core. It is possible to use either of the debugger front ends and dynamically transition between them if you configure the kernel properly at compile and runtime [Homepage](https://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/jwessel/kdb/)
